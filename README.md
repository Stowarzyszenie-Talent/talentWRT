# Talent's openWRT config and utils

This repo contains a uci "template" for openWRT, which is meant to be applied
to Stowarzyszenie Talent's TP-link (and maybe Mikrotik) routers, which are meant to be simple APs.
  
An ``init`` script is provided for applying the template to a fresh (!) openWRT router.
If a device already has a desired system, but has some leftover configuration, run
something like ``first-boot && reboot now``.
